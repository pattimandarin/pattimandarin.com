      <description>Hi! Everyone, My name is Patti, a native Taiwanese teacher. I majored in Chinese literature and I love reading books and go mountain climbing.
I can teach:
How to speak authentic Taiwanese Mandarin (based on living or traveling experiences in Taiwan)
Business Chinese in a workplace setting (interviews, communicating with colleagues and clients)
Chinese used in popular Taiwanese dramas, movies, and music, with self-made teaching materials
I&amp;rsquo;m also currently learning Taiwanese and Japanese, I would like to share Taiwanese culture with you.</description>
